			<h1>The Tesla Coil</h1>
			<img src="tesla2.jfif" alt="tesla" width="600px" height="auto">
			<p>Chances are that you have already seen this invention. It is a tower (of any height)<br> that uses coils to shoot lightning out into the air. The capacitors store and build up<br> the energy to create a spark gap then shoot the energy into the air like lightning bolts.<br> Tesla Coils can be found in museums and science centers as entertainment, they never took on much of a<br> purpose beyond scientific testing.</p>
			<h1>The Magnifying Transmitter</h1>
			<img src="tesla3.jpg" alt="tesla" width="600px" height="auto">
			<p>One of Tesla’s biggest obsessions was providing power wirelessly and he had intended<br> the Tesla Coil to be part of his wireless power systems. To test this, <br>he built two record-breaking Tesla Coils. The towers shot out lightning bolts 130 feet long<br>. Tesla was considered to be ahead of his time and wireless electrical power didn’t get<br> officially developed until the mid-2010’s. Today it still isn’t as prevalent as it could be.</p>
			<h1>The Radio</h1>
			<img src="tesla8.png" alt="tesla" width="600px" height="auto">
			<p>Before his lab burnt down, Tesla was working on developing a radio. He was going to send<br> the signal 50 miles but before he could rebuild his lab and his equipment,<br> an Italian man in England was able to secure the patent for the device. Tesla’s radio<br> would have been stronger if he had been able to use it.</p>
			<h1>The Neon Lamp</h1>
			<img src="tesla7.jpg" alt="tesla" width="600px" height="auto">
			<div> Tesla did not invent the fluorescent or neon lights but he did contribute to improving both inventions.<br> He took the lights and created the first neon sign.At the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair, he demonstrated<br> neon light signs and how they can make unique designs and even form words.<br> Thanks to Tesla you can identify your favorite bar.</p>
			<h1>The Induction Motor</h1>
			<img src="tesla6.jpg" alt="tesla" width="600px" height="auto">
			<p>Again, Tesla went head to head in creating an invention. This time Tesla won.<br> Ferrari may have presented their induction engine first but <br>Tesla had filed for his patents earlier. The motor uses electromagnets to spin.<br> It is commonly used in vacuums, blow dryers, and power tools, even today.</p>
